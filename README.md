This is a project on pure web components merely using native `HTML`、`CSS` and `JavaScript` technologies.

What are the advantages of View over other frameworks:

- based on web components.
- frameworkless, can be used in native environment and any other web framework like `Vue`、`React`、`Angular` and so on.
- tiny and high performance.
- easy to use and beautiful user interface.
